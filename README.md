# Ali's ROM Hacks
## Intro and about patching 
A collection of my ROM hacks and assets in a legally safe way i.e. no ROMs, if you want/need those,

you really should know about No-Intro already, but speaking of ROMs. All patches are to be applied

with xdelta, or [xdelta UI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) if you're not a *l337 h4x0r*,
this repo exists to both host them in their unfinished state,

as well as serve as a backup should I have issues or [ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/) is down for maintenance or something.

Anyhow, onto the hacks themselves

### Ali's Icecapade
A simple and short hack of Super Mario World made for a Christmas competition at [Fortaleza Reznor](https://www.fortalezareznor.com/)

It's all about constant movement, the ice physics+sliding was the only vanilla way I could quickly create constant momentum, like Sonic
